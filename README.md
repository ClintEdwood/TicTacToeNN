# TicTacToeNN
A simple model and implementation, how one could train a NN to learn to play Tic Tac Toe.

This project was initiated with the aim of gaining more practice and experience in the field of neural networks. The foundation of the project is based on an existing implementation of a TicTacToe game, which was initially created by a fellow student. I have built upon this foundation and expanded its functionalities.

To collect data for training the neural network, I modified the game implementation so that I can assume the role of the second player and store the moves. This version can be found in the "TicTacGatherData" directory. The Python file "tictacModel.py" utilizes this collected data to train the model.

Furthermore, I rewrote the base implementation to incorporate the trained neural network as the second player. Python 3.8 was used for the implementation.

To play against the neural network, simply run the "main.py" file located in the root directory of the "tic" folder.
